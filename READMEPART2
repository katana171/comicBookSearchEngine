This is a project my friend and I put together for a our JAVA2 final project, looking back there is so much we could fix and do better as we feel we aremuch better programmers. Well thats the point of learning is to get better, you have to start somewhere right :)

When you start the program, you will be directed to the main search page.  You will be able to view and access the pre set comic list that we have prepared. You can iterate through the list of comic books by clicking the navigation buttons at the bottom of the page.  In addition, you can search by title in the search bar by entering a search key. When search button is selected, the list of comic books will be displayed.

If there is a comic you would like to edit or delete, select it first on the search page and then click the edit button. On the edit page, you can either edit or delete the comic.

If you would like to create a comic, click the create button.  You will be able to fill the entries followed by save button to create a new comic.

note: Please take a look at the glowing navigation buttons. They look great :)
